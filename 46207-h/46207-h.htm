<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Pardon me, old chappie, you mean waltz, don’t you
know?</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> Well, <i>waltz</i> the difference? I wonder where those

here in a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Indeed?</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> No, in a cab! You see, I’ve been on with Jane—that’s
her name—some time, and she’s a nice girl, only she is mighty partickler. She doesn’t like
me loving and courting other girls.</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Very likely.</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> Well, she’ll be down here presently, so I must keep
myself very quiet, you know.</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Ah, well, in the meanwhile we will have a little
refreshment! Come along, old chappie! Awfully jolly place this, don’t you know!</p>

my fare home and a pipe-cleaner. I suppose I must face it out. (<i>Aloud.</i>) By the way,
what say you if we have a drink, eh?</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Ah, a good idea! Awfully jolly, old fellow!</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Yes, it will be if I have to pay.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) What shall it be?</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Champagne.</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> Of course—of course! (<i>Aside.</i>) My fare home looks
sick. All right!</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> All right. Kaffers win, tails Zulus. (<i>Aside.</i>)
I’ve only got a trouser button to toss with. Never mind, here goes.</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Now, then. (<i>They toss up. Alphonzo pretends to lose
his coin; begins looking for it.</i>) Have you lost something, old boy?</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> (<i>Still looking.</i>) Yes; but it’s of no
consequence—only a ten-pound note. Never mind, old boy, it will do for the parkkeeper.</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Do you always toss with notes?</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> Yes; I attach more importance to notes than money in
coin.</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Why so?</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> Why, you see if you put a five-pound note in your
waistcoat pocket, you <i>double</i> it; and when you bring it out again you see it
<i>increases</i>.</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Ah, awfully jolly! I’ll remember that!</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) So will I. I read it in

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> But, joking on one side, I must pay for the drinks.</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> No, no, old fellow; I really——</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Now, once and for all you are not going to pay——</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) No, I’m not. (<i>Aloud.</i>) But I
insist!</p>

<p><span class="name">Aug.</span> Once for all you can’t pay.</p>

idea! But I’ll find out where this figure is. It is in some public gardens. (<i>Looks at

hairdresser; and what would people say if they saw me talking to a goddess with only her
nightdress on?</p>

<p><span class="name">Venus.</span> You speak empty words. I know not what you mean. But

never be. Let this suffice you, that I am here to fulfil the troth you have plighted.</p>

<p><span class="name">Alph.</span> I don’t think so! I really must decline your generous

<p><span class="name">Hand.</span> Well, I can hardly believe my senses! There was the
statue before my very eyes; there were the thieves in the very act of stealing the antique
marble before my eyes; there was everything before my eyes, and, blow me, if it didn’t
disappear before my eyes. It’s the most mysterious affair I ever came across. I—who have
been in the Criminal Investigation Department for over thirty years, and reckoned the
finest man for having innocent men and women hanged and transported—done. I’ve been had by
some illusion? What shall I do? Shall I resign my position in the force, and go back to
tripe dressing? No—no! I’ll have a case ere to-morrow or my name is not Handsaw. Ah, what
is that I see? A little boy eating bread and dripping in the open street, before the gaze
of the passers-by? Oh, this <i>must</i> be seen into! I should lose <i>all</i> respect for
myself as a member of the force if I didn’t lock some poor little innocent little child up
for doing nothing. It’s a way we’ve got in the force. Now, then, my bold and massive
wretch of three years old, I’m down on you like two ton of bricks!</p>

left open, our tom cat rushed in and sneaked a couple of chickens—so didn’t he have
chickens?</p>

<p><span class="name">First R.</span> Go on, you fathead. I could have told you that.</p>

<p><span class="name">Second R.</span> Well, why didn’t you? Here, I sha’n’t go in for
sneaking statues again. I believe they are all pretty well alive. Didn’t you ever hear of

know, I think I was made for something better than hard work?</p>

<p><span class="name">First R.</span> You work? Why, you never robbed an honest man of a

in for di’mons!</p>

<p><span class="name">First R.</span> No; you don’t understand me. Suppose now I were to
go into a di’mond merchant’s and asked him to show me some of his most valuable di’monds,
what would be the first thing he would show me?</p>

for the blooming mess we’ve made over this statue business—what shall we say to the bloke
that paid us to sneak this marble Venus?</p>

statue in a shed, get the money off him, tell him we’ll go and fetch the figure, and—do a

<p>In general, inconsistencies in spelling and grammar in the source text have not been
changed. For example, Alphonzo’s last name is spelled both “Latherem” and  “Latherum”. No
attempt has been made to make the spelling consistent. On p. 7, a stage direction
reads:</p>

<p class=" blockquote italics">Alphonzo don’t know what he’s doing, goes to shave old man
with fender, &amp;c., and any silly business, ad lib.</p>

<p class="no_indent">The grammar has been retained. Emendations were made to correct for
minor printing problems in the copy used in this transcription. For example, on p. 4, the
text reads:</p>

<p class=" blockquote"><span class="name">Jane.</span> (<i>Cryi g</i>.) I ain’t—I don’t
want to cajole you!</p>

<p class="no_indent">“<i>Cryi g</i>” was changed to “<i>Crying</i>”. In cases such as
this, the obvious reading was given the benefit of the doubt without comment.</p>

<p>The following changes were made to the text:</p>

<ul>
<li>p. 2: TABLEA—Changed to “TABLEAU”</li>

<li>p. 5: <span class="name">Augustus.</span> (<i>Calling from inside</i>) Latherum, are
you coming?—Inserted a period after “inside” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 5: <span class="name">Augustus</span> (<i>Inside.</i>) She’s gone into
hysterics.—Inserted a period after “<i>Augustus</i>” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 6: window at back, with curtain, shaving chairs, shampooing table, &amp;c.; table,
chairs, &amp;c., Screen at back.—Deleted the comma after “chairs, &amp;c.”</li>

<li>p. 7: <span class="name">Alph.</span> (<i>Frightened</i>). I’m not guilty.—Put period
after “(<i>Frightened</i>)” inside parenthesis for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 7: I’ll say what I’ve got to here. always deal straightforward.—Inserted the word
“I” before “always”.</li>
</ul>
